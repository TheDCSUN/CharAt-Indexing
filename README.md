# CharAt-Indexing
Finding the character of any index of a string directly in the console.

⚠️This is a test program⚠️
We all have used the next().charAt(0) function in Scanner class to input a character from the user. 
The integer '0' in parentheses gave me an idea. What if we replace the 0 with other integers? Will we be able to pick
certain characters from the user in the terminal itself? 
So I present to everyone, this simple program to find it out. You can run it and check.
